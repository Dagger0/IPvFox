Firefox extension to list the hosts, and corresponding IPs, from which a page
and its resources are loaded.

AMO listing: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipvfox/

IPvFox is essentially a Firefox version of the Chrome extension IPvFoo:
  http://code.google.com/p/ipvfoo/
although they're by different authors and don't share any code.


Compiling
---------

Run `make`. The included Makefile requires 'zip' and is tested on Cygwin, but
it ought to work on Linux too.

Alternately, you can just zip up the contents of ext/ into an .xpi file.


Installing
----------

The Makefile will leave you with two files in build/: an XPI and a proxy file.
The XPI file can be installed by dragging/dropping it onto Firefox, but if
you're planning on doing some hacking, you should instead copy the proxy
file to your Firefox profile's extensions/ folder. The extension will then be
loaded directly from wherever you ran `make`.
